# Federated Groups - Feature Specifications & Issues

Federated groups enable self-governed spaces where members from different servers coordinate, collaborate, and organize around shared topics without platform lock-in.

---

## Implement group creation and settings

Users with appropriate permissions can create, manage, and delete groups with customizable settings.

- [x] Create new group with name, description, icon, and banner image
- [x] Edit group metadata (name, description, images)
- [x] Lock/archive group
- [x] Delete group and handle cleanup (member removals, content deletion) - soft delete only
- [ ] Set group code of conduct and rules
- [x] Configure membership & privacy settings (Open/Visible/Private presets)

**Related Areas:** Authentication, Permissions, Database Schema

---

## Implement member joining, leaving, and role assignment

Members can join groups, leave at any time, and admins can manage membership, roles, and permissions.

- [x] Users can join open groups with one click (after reading code of conduct)
- [x] Users can request to join moderated-join groups
- [ ] Mods can approve/reject join requests (-> UI structure exists but workflow incomplete)

- [x] Private groups: non-members see minimal info and posts are private-to-members by default
- [ ] Unlisted groups: not listed in directories, minimal info visible if you have the group link

**Membership & Participation:**
- [x] Open: anyone can follow, join, and participate
- [x] Semi-open: anyone can follow, and submit posts to mods. Only members can post directly. (partially implemented)
- [x] Closed: anyone can follow, but joining and participation requires requesting-to-join and being approved (or being invited)
- [ ] Invite-only: Following and joining require being invited first

**Federation:**
- [ ] Group archipelago: control which remote servers/actors can see/join (blocklists and allowlists)

- [x] Remote users can see posts from groups they follow in their feeds
- [x] Remote users can reply to group posts
- [x] Remote users can @-mention groups (which gets posted into the group or including in submitted posts queue for moderation, or only shown to mods depending on permissions)
- [x] Remote users can discover known groups via search

**Related Areas:** ActivityPub, Federation, Serialization

---

# FEP-400e: Publicly-appendable Collections Alignment

This section maps features from [FEP-400e: Publicly-appendable ActivityPub collections][fep-400e] to Bonfire's implementation. FEP-400e describes how to handle collections where others can contribute content (like walls, forums, photo albums in groups) while the owner retains authority.

## Core Concepts - Match Status

### Collection Ownership and Authority

| FEP-400e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Collection has valid globally-unique `id` | ✅ Implemented | Category/group has canonical URL |
| Collection owner retains complete authority | ✅ Implemented | Via boundaries/ACL system |
| Collection exposed in actor representation | ⚠️ Partial | Group outbox exposed, but not as named collection field |

### Using `target` in Objects

| FEP-400e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Objects include `target` field with collection reference | ⚠️ Partial | May use `context` instead of `target` |
| `target` contains `type`, `id`, `attributedTo` | ⚠️ Partial | Need to verify exact structure |
| Object understood in context of collection | ✅ Implemented | Posts associated with group/channel |

### Add/Remove Activities

| FEP-400e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Server sends `Add` activity when object added to collection | ❌ Not implemented | Uses `Announce` instead |
| Server sends `Delete` activity for removal | ✅ Implemented | Soft delete federates |
| Server sends `Move` activity between collections | ❌ Not implemented | No cross-collection move |

## Protocol Activities Mapping

| FEP-400e Activity | Purpose | Bonfire Status |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| `Create` with `target` | Create object in collection | ⚠️ Different - uses `context` or group mention |
| `Add` | Confirm object added to collection | ❌ Not implemented (uses Announce) |
| `Delete` | Remove object from collection | ✅ Implemented |
| `Move` | Move between collections | ❌ Not implemented |
| `Reject{Create}` | Reject submission | ❌ Not implemented |

## Bonfire Features Related to FEP-400e

- **Post submission queue** - Aligns with FEP-400e's moderation concept
- **Channel/group posting** - Posts belong to collections, but uses different mechanism
- **Group authority** - Owner/mod authority over content aligns with FEP-400e intent

## FEP-400e Requirements NOT Met

- [ ] **`target` field usage** - Implement proper `target` field instead of/alongside `context`
- [ ] **`Add` activity** - Send `Add` when confirming post to group (currently uses `Announce`)
- [ ] **`Move` activity** - Support moving posts between channels/groups
- [ ] **`Reject{Create}`** - Federate rejection of submitted posts
- [ ] **Collection endpoints** - Expose named collection fields in group actor

# FEP-db0e: Non-public Group Authentication Alignment

This section maps features from [FEP-db0e: Authentication mechanism for non-public groups][fep-db0e] to Bonfire's implementation. FEP-db0e defines "actor tokens" for authenticating access to private group content hosted on other servers.

## Core Concepts - Match Status

### Actor Tokens

| FEP-db0e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| `sm:actorToken` endpoint in actor | ❌ Not implemented | No token endpoint |
| Token with `issuer`, `actor`, timestamps | ❌ Not implemented | No token generation |
| RSA-SHA256 signed tokens | ❌ Not implemented | No token signing |
| Time-limited validity (max 2 hours) | ❌ Not implemented | N/A |

### Fetching Private Content

| FEP-db0e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| HTTP signature for fetching from group server | ✅ Implemented | Standard AP signatures |
| Actor token for fetching from other servers | ❌ Not implemented | No token-based auth |
| `Authorization: ActivityPubActorToken` header | ❌ Not implemented | N/A |

### Token Verification

| FEP-db0e Requirement | Bonfire Status | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Verify HTTP signature matches token `actor` | ❌ Not implemented | N/A |
| Check validity timestamps | ❌ Not implemented | N/A |
| Verify object belongs to collection owned by `issuer` | ❌ Not implemented | N/A |

## Bonfire's Current Approach

Bonfire uses a different approach for private group content:

- **Boundaries system** - Fine-grained ACL controls visibility
- **HTTP signatures** - Standard ActivityPub authentication
- **Server-side enforcement** - Visibility checked on fetch

## FEP-db0e Implementation Status

This FEP is largely **not implemented** in Bonfire. The boundaries system provides local access control, but the federated token mechanism for cross-server private group content verification is not present.

### Gaps to Address

- [ ] **Actor token endpoint** - Add `sm:actorToken` endpoint to group actors
- [ ] **Token generation** - Implement signed token creation for members
- [ ] **Token verification** - Accept and verify tokens on content fetch
- [ ] **Cross-server private groups** - Enable private group content to be fetched securely from member's servers

### Considerations

- FEP-db0e is primarily implemented by Smithereen
- May be needed for full private group interop with Smithereen
- Bonfire's boundaries system may need adapter layer for this mechanism

# Specification Comparison

This section compares the SWICG Groups Taskforce specification with the FEPs to understand their relationships, overlaps, and differences.

## Scope and Focus

| Specification | Primary Focus | Status |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **SWICG Groups Taskforce** | Comprehensive group protocol with user stories | Draft/In Progress |
| **FEP-1b12** | Practical group federation (Lemmy-compatible) | Final |
| **FEP-400e** | Publicly-appendable collections (building block) | Final |
| **FEP-db0e** | Private group authentication via actor tokens | Final |

## Group Actor Representation

| Aspect | SWICG | FEP-1b12 | FEP-400e | FEP-db0e |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Type | `Group` | `Group` | N/A (collection-focused) | N/A (auth-focused) |
| Has inbox/outbox | Yes (recommended) | Yes | N/A | Yes (for tokens) |
| Moderators | `admins` collection | `attributedTo` collection | `attributedTo` (owner) | N/A |
| Members | `members` collection | `followers` collection | N/A | N/A |

**Key difference**: SWICG uses explicit `members`/`admins` collections, while FEP-1b12 repurposes `followers` for members and `attributedTo` for moderators (Lemmy compatibility).

## Membership Protocol

| Action | SWICG | FEP-1b12 |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Request to join | `Join` activity | `Follow` activity |
| Leave group | `Leave` activity | `Undo(Follow)` activity |
| Approve join | `Accept(Join)` | `Accept(Follow)` |
| Reject join | `Reject(Join)` | `Reject(Follow)` |
| Remove member | `Remove` activity | Not specified |
| Invite member | `Invite` activity | Not specified |

**Key difference**: SWICG defines dedicated `Join`/`Leave` activities, while FEP-1b12 reuses the existing `Follow` mechanism. FEP-1b12's approach has wider existing implementation support (Lemmy, Friendica, etc.).

## Post Distribution Model

| Aspect | SWICG | FEP-1b12 | FEP-400e |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Post targeting | Not fully specified | `audience` property | `target` property |
| Distribution | `Announce` (implied) | `Announce` by group actor | `Add` by collection owner |
| Moderation queue | `Accept`/`Reject` post | Not specified | `Reject{Create}` |
| Content removal | Not specified | `Delete` | `Delete` |

**Key insight**: FEP-1b12 and FEP-400e offer **complementary** approaches:
- FEP-1b12's `Announce` model: Group actor redistributes posts to followers
- FEP-400e's `Add` model: Collection owner confirms content belongs to collection

These could be used together: `Add` to confirm membership in collection, `Announce` to distribute.

## Moderation and Roles

| Aspect | SWICG | FEP-1b12 | FEP-400e |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Moderator discovery | `admins` collection | `attributedTo` collection | `attributedTo` (owner only) |
| Add moderator | TBD | `Add` activity | N/A |
| Remove moderator | TBD | `Remove` activity | N/A |
| Authority model | Owner + admins | Moderators in `attributedTo` | Single owner |

**Key difference**: FEP-400e assumes single owner authority, while SWICG and FEP-1b12 support multiple moderators.

## Private/Restricted Groups

| Aspect | SWICG | FEP-1b12 | FEP-db0e |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Private content | Mentioned (user story) | Not addressed | Primary focus |
| Auth mechanism | Not specified | N/A | Actor tokens |
| Cross-server fetch | Not specified | N/A | Token in Authorization header |

**Key insight**: FEP-db0e fills a gap left by SWICG and FEP-1b12 - how do federated servers authenticate access to private group content when the content is hosted on a member's server?

## Compatibility Matrix

| | SWICG | FEP-1b12 | FEP-400e | FEP-db0e |
|---|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **SWICG** | — | ⚠️ Different membership model | ✅ Complementary | ✅ Complementary |
| **FEP-1b12** | ⚠️ Different membership model | — | ⚠️ Different distribution model | ✅ Complementary |
| **FEP-400e** | ✅ Complementary | ⚠️ Different distribution model | — | ✅ Complementary |
| **FEP-db0e** | ✅ Complementary | ✅ Complementary | ✅ Complementary | — |

## Conflicts and Tensions

### 1. Membership: `Join` vs `Follow`

- **FEP-1b12** uses `Follow`/`Undo(Follow)` (established practice)
- **SWICG** defines `Join`/`Leave` as dedicated activities

**Resolution**: FEP-1b12's approach has wider adoption. SWICG may need to accommodate both or defer to existing practice.

### 2. Post Distribution: `Announce` vs `Add`

- **FEP-1b12** uses `Announce` (group actor boosts the post)
- **FEP-400e** uses `Add` (post added to collection)

**Resolution**: Not mutually exclusive. Could use `Add` for collection semantics and `Announce` for distribution. However, implementations must agree on which to expect.

### 3. Moderator Discovery: `admins` vs `attributedTo`

- **SWICG** proposes `admins` collection
- **FEP-1b12** uses `attributedTo` collection

**Resolution**: `attributedTo` has existing implementation (Lemmy). SWICG could adopt this or define `admins` as an alias.

## Recommendations for Bonfire

Based on this analysis, recommended approach for Bonfire:

### Adopt from FEP-1b12 (pragmatic interop)
- [x] `Follow`/`Undo(Follow)` for membership ✅ Already implemented
- [ ] `audience` property on group posts
- [ ] `attributedTo` for moderators (expose alongside boundaries)
- [x] `Announce` for post distribution ✅ Already implemented

### Adopt from FEP-400e (collection semantics)
- [ ] `target` property on posts (alongside `context`)
- [ ] Consider `Add` activity for explicit collection membership
- [ ] `Reject{Create}` for moderation queue rejections

### Adopt from FEP-db0e (private groups)
- [ ] Actor tokens for private group interop (lower priority unless Smithereen interop needed)

### Keep from SWICG (future-proofing)
- [ ] Track `Join`/`Leave` activity developments
- [ ] Support `admins` collection alongside `attributedTo`
- [ ] Implement `Invite` activity when standardized

### Bonfire-specific (beyond specs)
- Boundaries/ACL system provides richer permissions than any spec
- Channels/subcategories extend group concept
- Group-scoped flagging for moderation

---

## Proposed: Group-Level Interaction Policy Vocabulary

Inspired by [GoToSocial's `interactionPolicy`](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/federation/interaction_controls/) and [FEP-044f] for post-level controls, we propose a similar vocabulary for **group-level interaction controls** that could express Bonfire's boundaries/ACL system in a federated way.

### Rationale

Current specs define *what* groups can do (FEP-1b12, FEP-400e) but not *who* can do *what* within a group. Different platforms implement this differently:
- Lemmy: hardcoded role system (admin, mod, member)
- Mastodon: no group support
- GoToSocial: post-level `interactionPolicy` (could extend to groups)
- Bonfire: flexible boundaries/ACL system

A standardized vocabulary would enable:
1. **Federated permission discovery**: Remote servers can query what actions are allowed
2. **Interoperability**: Different implementations can map their permission systems
3. **Transparency**: Users know what they can do before attempting actions

### Proposed `interactionPolicy` property on Group actors

A `interactionPolicy` property on Group actors (and on activities/object related to actors), containing sub-policies for each action type:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://gotosocial.org/ns#interactionPolicy"
  ],
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/1",
  "name": "Example Group",
  "interactionPolicy": {
    "canFollow": {
      "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canJoin": {
      "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canInvite": {
      "automaticApproval": ["followers", "attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canRead": {
      "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canPost": {
      "automaticApproval": ["followers"],
      "manualApproval": ["as:Public"]
    },
    "canReply": {
      "automaticApproval": ["followers"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canLike": {
      "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canAnnounce": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": ["followers"]
    },
    "canModerate": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canCurate": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": ["followers"]
    },
    "canGrant": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canEdit": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": []
    },
    "canDelete": {
      "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"],
      "manualApproval": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Sub-Policy Definitions

| Policy | Description | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `canFollow` | Who can follow the group (receive updates without membership) | Usually `as:Public` |
| `canJoin` | Who can become a member | Open groups: `as:Public`; Closed: `manualApproval` only |
| `canInvite` | Who can invite others | Members (`followers`) or mods only (`attributedTo`) |
| `canRead` | Who can view group content | Public groups: `as:Public`; Private: `followers` only |
| `canPost` | Who can create new posts/topics | Members, or moderated (public with manual approval) |
| `canReply` | Who can reply to posts | Usually same as `canPost`, or more open |
| `canLike` | Who can like/react to posts | Usually `followers` or `as:Public` |
| `canAnnounce` | Who can boost/share to the group | Often mod-only for curated groups |
| `canModerate` | Who can approve/reject content, manage members | Mods/admins (`attributedTo`) |
| `canCurate` | Who can pin, feature, or organize content | Mods or trusted members |
| `canGrant` | Who can assign roles/permissions to others | Usually owner or `attributedTo` only |
| `canManageAccess` | Who can manage access controls (block/allow users/instances), probably needs a better name | Usually `attributedTo` |
| `canEdit` | Who can edit others' content | Usually mods only |
| `canDelete` | Who can delete others' content | Usually mods only |

### Target Values

Following GoToSocial's pattern:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `as:Public` | Anyone (including non-members, remote actors) |
| `followers` | Group members (the group's followers collection) |
| `attributedTo` | Moderators/admins (from group's `attributedTo` property) |
| Specific actor URI | Individual actors (e.g., `"https://example.org/users/alice"`) |
| Custom collection URI | Custom role collections (e.g., `"https://example.org/groups/1/curators"`) |
| `members` | Group members collection (if using SWICG pattern, distinct from `followers`) |

#### Limitation: `followers` Conflates Subscription with Membership

FEP-1b12 uses `followers` as the group's member collection. This conflates two distinct concepts:

| Concept | Purpose | User Intent |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Following** (subscription) | Receive updates in feed | "Show me this group's posts" |
| **Membership** (permissions) | Have permissions within group | "I'm part of this community" |

This creates problems:

1. **Non-members can't follow**: A user might want to see public posts without formally joining
2. **Members can't unfollow**: A member might want to stay in the group but mute notifications
3. **Permission confusion**: Following a group automatically grants member permissions

**Alternative: SWICG's Separate `members` Collection**

The SWICG Groups Taskforce proposes using a dedicated `members` collection with `Join`/`Leave` activities:

```json
{
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/1",
  "followers": "https://example.org/groups/1/followers",
  "members": "https://example.org/groups/1/members"
}
```

With this pattern:
- **`Follow`/`Unfollow`** controls subscription (seeing posts in feed)
- **`Join`/`Leave`** controls membership (having permissions)

In `interactionPolicy`, this enables:

```json
"interactionPolicy": {
  "canPost": {
    "automaticApproval": ["members"]
  },
  "canRead": {
    "automaticApproval": ["followers", "members"]
  }
}
```

**Compatibility Approach**

For maximum compatibility:
- Use `followers` as member collection (FEP-1b12 pattern) for basic interoperability
- Optionally expose a separate `members` collection for implementations that support it
- In `interactionPolicy`, `"followers"` remains the safe default that all implementations understand

**Note**: Bonfire's implementation should consider supporting both patterns, using `followers` for federation compatibility while internally distinguishing between subscription and membership states.

### Approval Types

- **`automaticApproval`**: Action succeeds immediately without review
- **`manualApproval`**: Action requires moderator approval (enters queue)

An empty array means the action is not permitted for anyone in that approval type.


### Federation Considerations

1. **Discovery**: Remote servers can fetch the group actor (or a specific post or other object within a group) and read `interactionPolicy` to understand permissions before attempting actions

2. **Graceful degradation**: Servers not understanding `interactionPolicy` can fall back to:
   - FEP-1b12's `Follow`/`Accept` for membership
   - Standard moderation via `attributedTo`
   - Attempting an action which the remote server (home of the group) can reject/ignore (meaning any side effects should only be applied locally if the activity was accepted)

3. **Override at post level**: Individual posts within a group could override group-level policies using GoToSocial-style `interactionPolicy` for finer control

4. **Compatibility with existing specs**:
   - `followers` maps to FEP-1b12 member collection
   - `attributedTo` maps to FEP-1b12 moderator collection
   - `manualApproval` aligns with moderation queue concepts

### Example Scenarios

**Open public group** (anyone can join and post):
```json
"interactionPolicy": {
  "canJoin": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
  "canPost": { "automaticApproval": ["followers"] }
}
```

**Moderated group** (anyone can join, posts require approval):
```json
"interactionPolicy": {
  "canJoin": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
  "canPost": { "manualApproval": ["followers"] }
}
```

**Private/closed group** (invite-only, members can post freely):
```json
"interactionPolicy": {
  "canJoin": { "manualApproval": ["as:Public"] },
  "canInvite": { "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"] },
  "canPost": { "automaticApproval": ["followers"] }
}
```

**Announcement group** (mods post, members read-only):
```json
"interactionPolicy": {
  "canJoin": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
  "canPost": { "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"] },
  "canReply": { "automaticApproval": [] }
}
```

## Proposed: Group Relationships Vocabulary

Groups often have relationships with other groups - as related communities, equivalent representations across instances, or hierarchical parent/child structures (like Bonfire's channels within groups).

### Related Groups: `alsoKnownAs`

The existing ActivityStreams property `alsoKnownAs` can link equivalent or closely related groups:

```json
{
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://instance-a.org/groups/rust-dev",
  "name": "Rust Development",
  "alsoKnownAs": [
    "https://instance-b.org/groups/rust-programming",
    "https://instance-c.org/communities/rustaceans"
  ]
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Mirror/backup groups across instances
- Groups that merged or split
- Cross-platform equivalents (e.g., a Lemmy community and its Bonfire counterpart)
- Federated group migration (old → new location)

### Hierarchical Groups: Parent/Child Relationships

For nested structures like Bonfire's channels within groups, we propose using existing and extended properties:

#### Parent Reference: `context`

The existing `context` property can reference a parent group/channel:

```json
{
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust",
  "name": "Rust",
  "context": {
    "type": "Group",
    "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming",
    "name": "Programming"
  }
}
```

**Note:** `context` is already used in FEP-7888 for conversation threading. Using it for group hierarchy is consistent with its semantic meaning ("the context in which this exists").

#### Children Collection: Schema.org `hasPart`

For discovering child groups/channels, we recommend using Schema.org's established `hasPart`/`isPartOf` properties (requires extending the JSON-LD context):

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {"isPartOf": "schema:isPartOf", "hasPart": "schema:hasPart"}
  ],
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming",
  "name": "Programming",
  "hasPart": [
    {"type": "Group", "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust", "name": "Rust"},
    {"type": "Group", "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/python", "name": "Python"},
    {"type": "Group", "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/go", "name": "Go"}
  ]
}
```

And the child can then reference the parent with `isPartOf`:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {"isPartOf": "schema:isPartOf"}
  ],
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust",
  "name": "Rust",
  "isPartOf": "https://example.org/groups/programming"
}
```

**Note:** Using `context` (as shown above for parent reference) is also valid and aligns with FEP-7888, but `isPartOf` is more explicit about the hierarchical relationship, especially if using `hasPart` too.

**Why Schema.org properties?**
- `hasPart`/`isPartOf` are well-established with clear semantics
- Already used in JSON-LD contexts across the web
- More portable than defining new properties

#### Inheriting Permissions from Parent Group

A channel can optionally reference the parent group's collections in its `interactionPolicy`, allowing permission inheritance:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {"isPartOf": "schema:isPartOf"},
    "https://gotosocial.org/ns#interactionPolicy"
  ],
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust",
  "name": "Rust Channel",
  "isPartOf": "https://example.org/groups/programming",

  "attributedTo": [
    "https://example.org/groups/programming/attributedTo"
  ],
  "followers": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust/followers",

  "interactionPolicy": {
    "canJoin": {
      "automaticApproval": ["https://example.org/groups/programming/followers"]
    },
    "canPost": {
      "automaticApproval": ["followers"],
      "manualApproval": ["https://example.org/groups/programming/followers"]
    },
    "canModerate": {
      "automaticApproval": ["https://example.org/groups/programming/attributedTo"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key patterns:**

| Pattern | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Own members | `"followers"` | This channel's followers collection |
| Parent members | `"https://example.org/groups/programming/followers"` | Parent group's members can also interact |
| Parent mods | `"https://example.org/groups/programming/attributedTo"` | Parent group's mods can moderate this channel |
| Own mods | `"attributedTo"` | This channel's own moderators |

**Note:** The `attributedTo` of a channel can directly reference the parent's `attributedTo` collection, meaning the channel inherits its moderators from the parent rather than maintaining a separate list.

**Use cases:**
- **Shared membership**: Parent group members automatically gain access to child channels
- **Centralized moderation**: Parent group mods can moderate all child channels
- **Mixed model**: Channel has own members, but parent mods can still moderate
- **Isolated channel**: Channel uses only its own `followers`/`attributedTo` (no parent references)


### Complete Group Actor Example

Combining `interactionPolicy` with relationship properties:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://gotosocial.org/ns#interactionPolicy"
  ],
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust",
  "name": "Rust Programming",
  "summary": "A channel for Rust developers",
  "attributedTo": ["https://example.org/users/alice"],
  "followers": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust/followers",
  "inbox": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust/inbox",
  "outbox": "https://example.org/groups/programming/rust/outbox",

  "context": {
    "type": "Group",
    "id": "https://example.org/groups/programming",
    "name": "Programming"
  },

  "alsoKnownAs": [
    "https://other-instance.org/communities/rust"
  ],

  "interactionPolicy": {
    "canFollow": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
    "canJoin": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
    "canRead": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
    "canPost": { "automaticApproval": ["followers"], "manualApproval": [] },
    "canReply": { "automaticApproval": ["followers"] },
    "canLike": { "automaticApproval": ["as:Public"] },
    "canModerate": { "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"] },
    "canGrant": { "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"] },
    "canManageAccess": { "automaticApproval": ["attributedTo"] }
  }
}
```

### Cross-Instance Moderation Flows

When moderators are distributed across multiple instances, moderation actions require coordination between the remote moderator's instance and the group's home instance. This section documents how `interactionPolicy` with `manualApproval` handles these scenarios.

#### Alignment with FEP-044f

This flow follows FEP-044f's patterns for consent-based interactions:
- **`interactionPolicy`** with `automaticApproval`/`manualApproval` arrays (GoToSocial namespace)
- **`Accept`/`Reject`** responses to requests

However, unlike FEP-044f's `QuoteAuthorization` stamps, group moderation does **not** need separate authorization objects because:
- The group's home instance is the authority - it verifies permissions via `interactionPolicy` before acting
- Once the group executes the action (e.g., `Undo(Announce)`), that federated activity *is* the proof of authorization
- Third parties don't need to verify authorization separately - they just process the group's outgoing activities normally

This keeps the flow simpler while maintaining the same `interactionPolicy` vocabulary.

#### Scenario: Remote Mod Hides a Post

A moderator (`@mod@instance-b.org`) wants to hide a post that was shared to a group hosted on `instance-a.org`. "Hiding" means removing the group's `Announce` of that post.

**Group's interactionPolicy:**
```json
{
  "interactionPolicy": {
    "canModerate": {
      "automaticApproval": ["https://instance-a.org/users/admin"],
      "manualApproval": ["https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking/moderators"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `moderators` collection includes `@mod@instance-b.org`.

#### Flow 1: Remote Mod Requests Content Removal

**Step 1: Remote mod sends Delete(Announce) to group inbox**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://instance-b.org/activities/delete-announce-123",
  "type": "Delete",
  "actor": "https://instance-b.org/users/mod",
  "object": {
    "type": "Announce",
    "actor": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
    "object": "https://instance-c.org/posts/spam-post-456"
  },
  "target": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
  "to": ["https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking"]
}
```

**Step 2: Group's home instance checks policy**

The group server checks if `@mod@instance-b.org` is in:
1. `automaticApproval` for `canModerate` → No → don't auto-process
2. `manualApproval` for `canModerate` → Yes (via moderators collection) → queue for approval

**Step 3: Home instance queues for manual approval**

The request is queued. A notification is sent to actors with automatic moderation approval (e.g., the admin).

**Step 4a: Approval - Accept activity**

If approved by an admin:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://instance-a.org/activities/accept-456",
  "type": "Accept",
  "actor": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
  "object": "https://instance-b.org/activities/delete-announce-123",
  "to": ["https://instance-b.org/users/mod"]
}
```

The group then processes the deletion and sends `Undo(Announce)` to all followers:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://instance-a.org/activities/undo-announce-789",
  "type": "Undo",
  "actor": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
  "object": {
    "type": "Announce",
    "id": "https://instance-a.org/activities/announce-original",
    "actor": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
    "object": "https://instance-c.org/posts/spam-post-456"
  },
  "to": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public"],
  "cc": ["https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking/followers"]
}
```

**Step 4b: Rejection - Reject activity**

If rejected:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://instance-a.org/activities/reject-456",
  "type": "Reject",
  "actor": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
  "object": "https://instance-b.org/activities/delete-announce-123",
  "summary": "Moderation action not approved",
  "to": ["https://instance-b.org/users/mod"]
}
```

#### Flow 2: Using Flag for Content Reports

Alternatively, a remote moderator can use `Flag` to report content, which may be more appropriate when the mod doesn't have direct moderation rights:

**Step 1: Remote mod flags the content**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://instance-b.org/activities/flag-123",
  "type": "Flag",
  "actor": "https://instance-b.org/users/mod",
  "object": [
    "https://instance-c.org/posts/spam-post-456",
    "https://instance-a.org/activities/announce-original"
  ],
  "content": "This post violates group rules: spam/advertising",
  "target": "https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking",
  "to": ["https://instance-a.org/groups/cooking"]
}
```

**Step 2: Group processes Flag based on canFlag policy**

The group checks `canFlag` policy and queues for moderator review if the actor is authorized.

#### Automatic vs Manual Approval Matrix

| Moderator Location | In `automaticApproval` | In `manualApproval` | Result |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Home instance admin | ✅ | - | Action processed immediately |
| Home instance mod | ❌ | ✅ | Queued for admin approval |
| Remote instance mod | ❌ | ✅ | Queued for admin approval |
| Remote instance mod | ❌ | ❌ | Rejected (unauthorized) |
| Any member (not mod) | ❌ | ❌ | Rejected, use Flag instead |

#### Implementation Notes

1. **Pending Queue**: The group's home instance should maintain a queue of pending moderation actions awaiting approval.

2. **Notification**: When an action is queued, actors in `automaticApproval` should be notified (via their inbox or a dedicated moderation collection).

3. **Timeout**: Consider adding a timeout for pending actions (e.g., 7 days) after which they're auto-rejected.

4. **Audit Trail**: Both `Accept` and `Reject` activities should be logged for moderation transparency.

5. **Cascading**: If the removed content had replies, consider whether to cascade the removal or leave orphaned replies.

6. **Alternative: Direct Undo**: If the mod is in `automaticApproval`, they could send `Undo(Announce)` directly (though semantically `Delete` targeting the Announce is clearer for requesting removal of someone else's Announce).
